= Base Lab Configuration For CentOS 7

Michael Pare <michael.pare@mymail.champlain.edu>
version 0.1, 2020-04-12

== Abstract 
This Test Lab Guide (TLG) will provide the user with step-by-step instructions on how to configure a basic network configuration using CentOS 7 servers and a CentOS 7 client. The resulting test lab environment will provide a stable base for building other test labs. It is recommended that users preserve the start of their test machines once this walk-through has been successfully completed. In a physical environment the hard drive of the machine can be imaged. In a virtual environment, the “snapshot” or equivalent feature can be used to preserve the current state of the operating system. Preserving the working conditions of the basic test lab will allow the user to experiment without fear of having to completely rebuild their environment. The ultimate goal of the TLG is to familiarize the user with the CentOS 7 Operating system and how to deploy common network services based on that operating system, and ultimately enable the user to conduct their own experiments in a CentOS 7 based environment. 

== Introduction

The purpose of the Test Lab Guides (TLGs) is providing users with practical guidelines for deploying current operating systems in a way that results in a functional configuration. Using a TLG will instruct the user in which servers to create, how to configure the operating systems and services, and how to install and configure additional software. A TLG experience enables the user to experience the entire set-up process from start to finish.

This TLG is written with the goals of reusability and extensibility in mind. The purpose of this particular TLG is to enable the creation of a basic network utilizing CentOS 7 as the central operating system. Once this network is complete several other TLGs can be built on top of this base configuration.

Once this lab is completed, it would be wise to save the initial configuration. How this is best done will depend on how the test environment was originally deployed. A physical environment can be preserved by imaging the drives of each machine to be stored in a separate location and retrieved when needed. In a network deployed virtually, a snapshot can be taken of each machine. This will preserve the current settings and configurations. Preserving the lab in a functional state is important, because it allows for a functional configuration to be restored without completely repeating the base lab configuration steps. This is helpful for correcting after a mistake or generating a test environment for a new product.

== Overview of this Test Lab Guide

This document contains instructions for settings up the CentOS 7 base configuration test lab by deploying two servers running CentOS 7, one client running CentOS 7 and one firewall built on CentOS 7. Once completed, the lab will simulate the functioning of a private intranet.

Important: The instructions provided in this document are for educational purposes. They do not represent best practices nor are they recommendations for a production network. These configurations should not be put into place on a production network. This network should be deployed on a separate network specific to testing (physical or virtual).

=== Network Design

image::networkdiagram.jpg[network diagram, align="center"]

icon:fire[] *_Firewall_*

IP Address: 192.168.100.1/24

Hostname: firewall.college.com

	The Firewall’s purpose is to handle traffic between the Intranet and Internet. This means that it will act as a router directing traffic. There are two interfaces on Firewall, one is the external/Internet-facing called ens192 and the other is the internal/Intranet-facing called ens224.

icon:server[] *_DC1_*

IP Address: 192.168.100.2

Gateway: 192.168.100.1

DNS Server: 127.0.0.1

Hostname: dc1.college.com

	This will be configured as the Intranet’s Domain Name System (DNS) and the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server.
	
icon:database[] *_App1_*

IP Address: 192.168.100.3

Gateway: 192.168.100.1

DNS Server: 192.168.100.2

Hostname: app1.college.com

	This is an internal web and application server. 

icon:desktop[] *_Client1_*
IP Address: Dynamic

DNS Server: 192.168.100.2

Hostname: client1.college.com

	Client1 is a workstation that has the ability to switch between the Intranet and Internet subnet.
	
=== Hardware and Software Requirements

Minimum requirements:

* Four functioning computers or VMs for configuration with OpenBSD installed.
	
=== Using “Sudo”

When running many commands throughout these TLGs you may be required to use ‘sudo’ depending on the level of privilege the current user has.  The ‘sudo’ command allows the command following it to be run at superuser privileges.  It is important to note that the user must be in the ‘sudoers’ file in order to successfully use this command.  If you make the account an administrator while installing, it will be added to the ‘sudoers’ file automatically.  Once a command is preceded by ‘sudo’ the user will be prompted for the password for the account and then the command can be run at superuser privilege.  For details on how to give a user ‘sudo’ privilege see the Appendix (How to Give a User to Sudo Privileges).

== Configuring the Environment

=== *Step One - Configure Firewall*

[.lead]
The below instructions detail the installation and setup of Firewall. The last section, Troubleshooting, has some information on common problems that people come across.

.. icon:user[] User: root 
*** icon:key[] Password: Ch@mplain!18
.. icon:user[] User: champlain 
*** icon:key[] Password: S3cur1ty!18

=== Configure TCP/IP
. Ensure that Network Manager is running. Type `systemctl status NetworkManager`.
.. You should see “Active: active (running)” in green if it is running.
.. If it is not running, enter the command sudo `systemctl start NetworkManager.service`.
.. If the service fails to launch, check the logs by entering the command `sudo systemctl status NetworkManager.service -l`.
. This is for the Internet-facing interface. Enter the command `nmtui` to enter the Network Manager.
.. Select “Edit a connection.”
.. Select the Internet-facing interface, ens192, and use the arrow keys to select “<Edit…>”
.. Use the arrow keys to ensure that “IPv4 CONFIGURATION” is set to “<Automatic>”

. Restart the network using `sudo systemctl restart network`.

=== Install and Use of Nano

. Run the command sudo `yum install nano -y`.

=== Configure NAT Rules
	This will allow the system to act as a router and to allow traffic from the internal network out to the external network.
	
. Enable IP forwarding by entering the command `sudo echo “net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1” >> /etc/sysctl.d/ip_forward.conf`.
.. You will need to be root to perform this task. 
.. Switch back to champlain user afterwards using su champlain.
. Add the external-facing NIC to Firewalld’s “public” zone by typing: `sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-interface=ens192 --permanent`
.. Where ens192 is the name of the external interface
. Add the internal-facing NIC to Firewalld’s “internal” zone by typing: `sudo firewall-cmd --zone=internal --add-interface=ens224 --permanent`
.. Where “ens224” is the name of the internal interface
. Apply masquerading to the external Firewalld zone by typing: `sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-masquerade --permanent`
. Save those changes by typing: `sudo firewall-cmd --complete-reload`
. Enable NAT by entering the command `sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --direct --passthrough ipv4 -t nat -l POSTROUTING -o ens224 -j MASQUERADE -s 192.168.100.0/24`.
. Restart the firewall to save using `sudo firewall-cmd --reload`.
. Configure NAT rules on iptables. Enter the following commands.
	`sudo iptables -F`
	`sudo iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT`
	`sudo iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT`
. Ensure NAT rules on iptables remains on boot. Add in the commands from earlier for NAT by entering the command `sudo nano /etc/rc.local`. This will open the file in Nano Editor.
.. Add in the following at the end:

		# NAT Rules
		iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT
		iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT

image::natrules.jpg[Network Address Translation rules, align="center"]

.. The above ensures that the NAT rules are still in place on reboot.
.. Press Ctrl+X to exit the Nano Editor then hit Y to save the file and hit Enter to save it with the same name.
