= Unix Test Lab Guide Project

The Unix Test Lab Guide (UTLG) Project is designed to explain how to configure services and software in context to a real network.  There are many website tutorials and forums where you can find solutions to various technical problems.  There are guides that explain how to setup a service such as DHCP or DNS.  However, it often requires reviewing multiple websites to understand how those all work together.

This project is inspired by the http://www.tldp.org/[The Linux Documentation Project]  and the https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/1262.test-lab-guides.aspx[Microsoft Test Lab Guides].  Specifically, the Microsoft TLG site has a wealth of information on configuring various Microsoft services.  What is unique is that all guides start with a base configuration - the Base Test Lab Guide.  That is the starting network that should be referenced when learning how to incorporate a service.  That helps to provide reference and context to how it integrates into an existing infrastructure.  This is similar to what we are wanting to achieve with the UTLGs.

This project is by https://www.champlain.edu[Champlain College]  students to create documentation on how to setup a network from scratch using a consistent theme so those that want to learn a specific OS can do so in context to building a real network.  Anyone, however, can contribute to these documents, but must use the respective base lab guide as the starting point for the integration of a specific network service or software application.

While these guides use a virtual environment for the setup, the configurations would apply in a non-virtual environment.

We hope that you find these guides helpful and that you'll provide us feedback on how you are using these guides or, more importantly, contribute to the project.

You don't have to convert the documents to Asciidoc, we can do that for you after testing the instructions that are sent.
